# HackBio internship 2021

In the recent years, the value of computational research has manifested. To gain the essence of this type of computational reserach the merit of this internship has sky rocketed. Every contributor in this team is eager to learn new computational skills and are willing to help each other out to submit the final tasks needed. 
We will use these 7 programming languages: Unix, R, Python, Javascript, Matlab, C++, Julia

# Team pythagoras

our team not from a particular country instead we are from different countries and was given this chance to work together because of HackBio

# Members and contributors:
	Oluwaseyi (Team leader, Javascript),
	Alaa,
	Mamanu,
	Shadwa (R),
	Noha (python / MATLAB),
	Ahmed (C++),
	Zaki (python),
	Zahraa (Javascript),
	Amira (Julia)

# The internship will be five-weeks long with five stages

# Stage 0 

we have been asked to develop simple scripts individually with 7 programming language for each team. this scripts prints our personal data like names, emails, and accounts. then collaboratively we will develop a bash script that take all the outputs and turn them to an csv file.

# We will update the next stages soon.
just wait for us
